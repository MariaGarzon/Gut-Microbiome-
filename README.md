## Overview

An interarctive dashboard was developed to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which identifies microbes that colonize human navels.

The purpose was to aid in the identification of Bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins which taste like beef for the company Improbable Beef. 

## Technologies
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- Flask, SQLAlchemy
- Plotly.js
- D3

## Summary 

A panel was created for demographic information for each individual who volunteered. Specifically, volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
